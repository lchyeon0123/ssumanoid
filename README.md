In the object search mode, the screen is divided into 9 compartments and then the object is determined. The position of the robot was controlled so that the object was located at 5 and 8.

After finding the milk carton, I wrote a code to collect arms to hold the milk pack. It also went through the process of narrowing the arm spacing so that the robot can hold the milk pack harder. When holding the milk pack, the robot's head was coded down to check if it was out of danger zone.
